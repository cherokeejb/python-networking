# python-networking
In this repo I'll collect python scripts, eventually related to networking/security applications, and and include useful excercizes; starting off I'd like to copy in excersizes/notes from taking a basics class with Matt Domko (and reference text "24 hours of Python") and lab work from the Info Sec Book Club as part of Lean-In as well as at Brakeing Down Security [sic] when time allows
